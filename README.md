#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

#I interpret user needs as a way to increase the value of my companies product. I can use "user stories to help
#with improving my program and as a way to show the customer that the product I am delievering will meet their 
#specific needs. 

#How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

#I want to include continuous improvement while developing programs. When I normally approach a problem, I usually try 
#to just push a product before reviewing and considering how it can be improved while it is being created. I think that
#doing that would make the qulity of my product improve.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

#A good team member utilizes their strengths to help the team improve in areas where they are lacking. Not only that, 
#but a good team member is someone who is patient and listens to their team to understand how they communicate. At the 
#end of the day, we are all people, and we need to cooperate if we want things to be done correctly.
